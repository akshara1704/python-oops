'''__init__ method is like default constructor in C++ and Java.
Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state.

The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class
when an object of the class is created.

Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions)
that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.'''


class Student:
    def __init__(self,name,lastname):
        self.name=name
        self.lastname=lastname
        self.fullname= name + '_kumar_' + lastname

std1=Student("garv","mehra")
print(std1.fullname)
